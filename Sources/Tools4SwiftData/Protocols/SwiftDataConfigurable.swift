/// Types conforming to `SwiftDataConfigurable` must implement validation
/// logic to ensure the model's state is appropriate for usage.

/// This protocol is intended to be used as a configuration step in data
/// persistence or transfer processes.

    /// Implementing types should define validation logic that checks for
    /// correctness and completeness of the modelâ€™s data. For example, ensuring
    /// all required fields are populated or verifying that values are within
    /// acceptable ranges. Typically, this is called before attempting to use
    /// the model in a persistence or transfer operation.
